1.) The guests need to have a leader, this will be the fist guest chosen by the Minataur, who will choose a random guest generated between 0 and 99. Then the guest will eat the cupcake, the next guest who will be randomly chosen, will enter the maze and if there is no cupcake replace it, else they will do nothing. When the leader returns they will eat the cupcake and increment the count by 1 as they now know that 1 guest has atleast replaced the item.

2.) The best option was to use a queue. In number 1 the issue is that it would be hard to have each thread enter at a time and know when another thread was leaving, it would lead to an issue of knowing which thread should be allowd to enter. The issue with the second option is that it becomes hard to know which thread should enter the room next. The third option is the best as with a queue it allows each thread to get into a line and then the first guest in the line will be the first in the room, they will then be in the room, and when done let the next guest in, this allows for organization and each guest to enter the room in a organized way. To solve number 2 I used a Queue from the Chapeter 7 notes, I used it as it allows for the guests to queue and makes use of a lock and unlock method, which locks the element inside and then it gets unlocked when its done allowing the guest or thread to leave and giving it to the next guest in the queue.
